Testing PHPMyAdmin

In this project I'm trying to realise an appointments booking system.

Requirements:

A web server. (I use Apache2.4)
MySQL.
PHP. (Using PHP 7.3.10)
PHPMyAdmin.

You can also use a web-host service which provides support to PHP, MySQL and PHPMyAdmin.

Update 08/20/2020@1:26 P.M.:
This is just a test version for PHPMyAdmin. It just takes data from an HTML form and puts them in a table, showing data on the screen.
